### Hands-on

##### For

1. Define
   - _i_ variable with shorthand notation and assign _1_
   - Define iteration with _i_ is less than or equal _3_
   - Print every iteration _i_ variables
   - Add _+1_ value every iteration to _i_ variable

###### Expect

```
1
2
3
```

2. Define for loop on one statement and the condition is less than 3. Print every iteration the value

###### Expect

```
0
1
2
```

3. Define for loop on with _range_ keyword, condition is less than 3 and print every iteration the value

```
0
1
2
```

4. Define for loop without condition and use the _break_ keyword, print "loop" value

```
loop
```

5. Define for loop with _range_ to 6. Check if iteration divided by 2 don't do anything, else print the iteration number

```
1
3
5
```
